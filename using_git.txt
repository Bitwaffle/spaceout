Quickly set up a Spaceout project with Git and Eclipse!

- If you haven't, set up git. Follow the instructions at http://help.github.com/set-up-git-redirect/
 
 - Log in to bitbucket, go to your account settings, and put in your SSH key (from the previous link)
 
 - In a terminal, cd to your Eclipse workspace (in Eclipse, go to 'File -> Switch Workspace -> Other...' to see your current workspace)
 
 - Now, do 'git clone git@bitbucket.org:bitwaffle/spaceout.git'. This should get all the files you'll need.
 
 - Open up Eclipse (make sure you're in the workspace you cloned spaceout into)
 
 - Now, go to File -> New -> Java Project
 
 - Type in 'spaceout' as the project name. Eclipse should say something about a wizard, just click next and let it do magicks.
 
 - Click the little arrow next to the Run arrow and click "Run configurations..." then go to the "Arguments" tab
 
 - In "Program arguments:" put "${workspace_loc:spaceout/lib/natives/OS}" where OS is 'linux', 'windows', 'macosx', or 'solaris' (hahahah solaris)
 
 - Compile and run the game; if it works you're ready to get coding, monkey! If not, shoot me an email at nate272@gmail.com

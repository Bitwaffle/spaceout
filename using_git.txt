Quick set up a Spaceout project with Git and Eclipse!

- First off, set up git. Follow the instructions at http://help.github.com/set-up-git-redirect/
 You'll also have your SSH key, which you'll need.
 
 - Login to bitbucket, go to your account settings, and put in your ssh key (from the previous link)
 
 - In a terminal, go to your Eclipse workspace
 
 - Do 'git init' if you havent already
 
 - Now, do 'git clone git@bitbucket.org:bitwafflespaceout.git'. This should get all the files you'll need.
 
 - Open up Eclipse (make sure you're in the workspace you put spaceout into)
 
 - Now, go to File -> New -> Java Project
 
 - Type in 'spaceout' as the project name. Eclipse should say something about a wizard, just click next and let it do magicks.
 
 - You should now have a new project with your clone in it.
 
 - Right click on the 'spaceout' project and click 'Properties' (or press Alt+Enter)
 
 - Select 'Java Build Path' in the left pane, then select the 'Libraries' tab. There should already be the libraries there.
 
 - Click on the little arrow next to 'lwjgl.jar'. Select 'Native library location'.
 
 - Browse to your eclipse workspace, then go to 'spaceout/lib/native'. Select the folder that corresponds to your operating system.
 
 - Make sure the game runs; if it does then you're ready to get coding, monkey!
 
 - Once you're done with your work, you can do 'git status' to see what you've changed.
 
 - Do a 'git add [filename]' for each file then do 'git commit'
 
 - Enter a comment about the commit in the file that pops up.
 
 - Now, do "git push origin master" to push your commit to the origin.

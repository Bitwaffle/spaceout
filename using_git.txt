Quickly set up a Spaceout project with Git and Eclipse!

- If you haven't, set up git. Follow the instructions at http://help.github.com/set-up-git-redirect/
 
 - Log in to bitbucket, go to your account settings, and put in your SSH key (from the previous link)
 
 - In a terminal, cd to your Eclipse workspace (in Eclipse, go to 'File -> Switch Workspace -> Other...' to see your current workspace)
 
 - Now, do 'git clone git@bitbucket.org:bitwaffle/spaceout.git'. This should get all the files you'll need.
 
 - Open up Eclipse (make sure you're in the workspace you cloned spaceout into)
 
 - Now, go to File -> New -> Java Project
 
 - Type in 'spaceout' as the project name. Eclipse should say something about a wizard, just click next and let it do magicks.
 
 - You should now have a new project with your clone in it.
 
 - Right click on the 'spaceout' project and click 'Properties' (or press Alt+Enter)
 
 - Select 'Java Build Path' in the left pane, then select the 'Libraries' tab. There should already be the libraries there.
 
 - Click on the little arrow next to 'lwjgl.jar'. Select 'Native library location'.
 
 - Browse to your eclipse workspace, then go to 'spaceout/lib/native'. Select the folder that corresponds to your operating system.
 
 - Compile and run the game; if it works you're ready to get coding, monkey! If not, shoot me an email at nate272@gmail.com

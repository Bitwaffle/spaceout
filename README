STORY:

You are thrust into a future age where faster-than-light space travel has been made 
possible through warp drives. They are not cheap, and can only be fitted
on large spacecrafts known as motherships. (WIP)

+-----------------+
|  SHIP CLASSES:  |
+-----------------+

TRANSPORT CLASS
+ Size: Collosal
+ Purpose: Large scale transport, warping between systems
+ Carries a certain number of ships, and crew on board
+ You can walk around inside of transport class ships

	Mothership - This is your space station away from home
	- Crew aids in mothership tasks.
	- All ships which fit in a hanger can be flown in and out of motherships.
	- Can warp around inside star-system but has long cooldown (10minutes?)

	Carrier - Designed for hauling ships and goods between planets, stations and systems.
	- Only shuttles can be flown in or out of carriers	
	- Larger ship hanger and cargo space than any other class
  - Hangers are not large enough for other transport ships
	- Carriers always require a crew of a certain size to operate
	- Carriers require the largest warpdrive to operate

-----------------
FIGHTER CLASS
+ Size: Medium, Small
+ Purpose: Combat, Exploration
+ Carries a microwarp drive that allows for faster in-system travel, but no combat.
+ Carries an advanced weapons/defense system allowing for different types of combat.
+ Used for landing on/departing planets

WIP

-----------------
INDUSTRIAL CLASS
+ Size: Large
+ Purpose: Hauling, Asteroid Mining, Industrial Ops
+ Strong defense/evasion system, but minimal weapons

	Mining Ship - Uses mining lasers and tractor beams to gather resources from asteroids
	- Much larger cargo space than Fighter class 
	- Fits a small microwarp drive
	- Has small to zero crew space

	Blockade Runner - Fast, expensive ship, designed for hauling goods through unfavorable space.
	- Larger cargo space than Fighter class
	- Fits a microwarp drive.
	- Strong evasive defense system (perhaps cloaking, chaffs, flares, and/or missile-targeting lasers)
	- Has no crew space

--------------
MICRO CLASS
+ Size: Tiny
+ Purpose: Cheap, fast.
+ Micros can not carry weapons, industrial riggs, or complex defense systems.

	Shuttle - A cheap way to get from a nearby station, to your mothership.

	Pod - All ships need escape pods!
	- This is what you fly when your ship goes bye-bye!
	- No weapons or defenses, but FAST. (like built-in microwarp fast)
	- Can board abandoned ships.

|   STORY   |
+-----------+

On the bicentennial of the desertion of Earth, the final habitable planets and 
moons in a small group of planetary systems have been successfully terraformed 
by a single government entity. The planets and moons at the furthest ends of the 
habitable regions are largely over-looked by the unified government and as a 
result they are controlled mostly by small, technologically-poor, local powers.

+---------------+
| Game details: |
+---------------+ 

When the game starts, you choose your Name, Gender, and Faction. Based on your
faction, you will be allowed to choose from a number of starting ships. Each 
faction will have ships that behave differently from eachother, as well as 
having different strengths. When you choose a faction, your selection of
starter ships will each be geared for slightly different tasks, also. The
pirate faction is special in that you only get to choose from one starting
ship and all of your ships beyond that will have to be acquired via either
piracy, or the black market. There might be a special starting-mission for
pirates in order to earn their first good ship. Once you choose your faction
it may not be permanent, but you may only be a member of one of these factions
at a time, and changing factions is a matter of gaining favor.

+-----------------+
| FACTION DETAILS |
+-----------------+

= Government Faction
  Name: TBA
  Notes: 
    - The government has the most advanced starting ships. These ships
    primarily require proprietary upgrades that can only be purchased 
    through the manufacturer or on the black market.
    - The guilds of the government faction provide cost reductions to
    local government vendors. This is in contrast to the way outlaw
    guilds behave, as the governemnt controls large cities with a wider
    selection of goods than the smaller towns and villiages run by outlaws.

= Outlaw Faction
  Name: Outlaw (tentative)
  Notes:
    - Outlaw ships can be upgraded very easily, even by building the upgrade
    yourself given the right tools, and knowledge. Outlaw ship upgrades can also 
    be purchased through both proprietary and non-proprietary vendors, as well 
    as the black market.
    - Assuming that you are not wanted for breaking any government laws, you
    are free to visit government controlled areas and purchase goods from
    them at full cost.

= Pirate Faction
  Name: Pirate 
  Notes:
    - The pirates don't choose a starting ship from a ship selection, instead
    they recieve a mission to comandeer a government or outlaw ship.
    - Since pirates are not welcome among other factions, they must acquire 
    better ships through pirating/salvaging, or the black market.
    - Pirates have no allegiances, but are generally unwelcome in government 
    or outlaw controlled areas, so they will be able to make use of disguise.

+---------------------+
| NPC FACTION DETAILS |
+---------------------+

= Engineered Life Form
  Name: ELF (Engineered Life Form)
  Notes: 
    - Scary, in-human killing machine.
    - Origin unknown, presumably created by the government faction.

+-------------------+
| NPC GUILD DETAILS |
+-------------------+

Guilds will exist for each faction that a player is a part of. A player
may become friendly with a guild by gaining enough favor from the guild.
Whenever a player gains favor for a particular faction, the player will
lose favor from any factions that don't get along. Guild alliances and 
feuds will be desplayed clearly to the player in an in-game menu.

= Pirate Guilds
  Name: TBA, separate NPC pirate guilds
  Notes:
    - Many pirate guilds don't get along. Choose carefully.

= Outlaw Factions
  Name: TBA, separate outlaw alliances
  Notes:
    - Sometimes outlaw guilds don't get along. Choose wisely.

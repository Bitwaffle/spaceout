STORY:

You are thrust into a future age where faster-than-light space travel has been made 
possible through warp drives. They are not cheap, and can only be fitted
on large spacecrafts known as motherships. (WIP)

+-----------------+
|  SHIP CLASSES:  |
+-----------------+

TRANSPORT CLASS
+ Size: Collosal
+ Purpose: Large scale transport, warping between systems
+ Carries a certain number of ships, and crew on board
+ You can walk around inside of transport class ships

	Mothership - This is your space station away from home
	- Crew aids in mothership tasks.
	- All ships which fit in a hanger can be flown in and out of motherships.
	- Can warp around inside star-system but has long cooldown (10minutes?)

	Carrier - Designed for hauling ships and goods between planets, stations and systems.
	- Only shuttles can be flown in or out of carriers	
	- Larger ship hanger and cargo space than any other class
  - Hangers are not large enough for other transport ships
	- Carriers always require a crew of a certain size to operate
	- Carriers require the largest warpdrive to operate

-----------------
FIGHTER CLASS
+ Size: Medium, Small
+ Purpose: Combat, Exploration
+ Carries a microwarp drive that allows for faster in-system travel, but no combat.
+ Carries an advanced weapons/defense system allowing for different types of combat.
+ Used for landing on/departing planets

WIP

-----------------
INDUSTRIAL CLASS
+ Size: Large
+ Purpose: Hauling, Asteroid Mining, Industrial Ops
+ Strong defense/evasion system, but minimal weapons

	Mining Ship - Uses mining lasers and tractor beams to gather resources from asteroids
	- Much larger cargo space than Fighter class 
	- Fits a small microwarp drive
	- Has small to zero crew space

	Blockade Runner - Fast, expensive ship, designed for hauling goods through unfavorable space.
	- Larger cargo space than Fighter class
	- Fits a microwarp drive.
	- Strong evasive defense system (perhaps cloaking, chaffs, flares, and/or missile-targeting lasers)
	- Has no crew space

--------------
MICRO CLASS
+ Size: Tiny
+ Purpose: Cheap, fast.
+ Micros can not carry weapons, industrial riggs, or complex defense systems.

	Shuttle - A cheap way to get from a nearby station, to your mothership.

	Pod - All ships need escape pods!
	- This is what you fly when your ship goes bye-bye!
	- No weapons or defenses, but FAST. (like built-in microwarp fast)
	- Can board abandoned ships.
